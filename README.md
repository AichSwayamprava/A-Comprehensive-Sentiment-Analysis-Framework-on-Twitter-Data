## Abstract

Twitter generates vast amounts of data reflecting public sentiment. This project uses supervised machine learning to analyze sentiments in tweets. We preprocess the tweets by removing special characters, stopwords, and performing lemmatization. We then apply TF-IDF vectorization to transform the preprocessed tweets into a numerical format, capturing the importance of words in each tweet relative to the entire dataset.
To improve prediction accuracy, we employ an ensemble of classifiers, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and Multinomial Naive Bayes. Each classifier provides a unique perspective on the sentiment analysis task, and by combining their predictions, we achieve a more robust and accurate sentiment classification model.
Our results demonstrate the efficacy of combining machine learning techniques for sentiment analysis on Twitter data. The ensemble model consistently outperforms individual classifiers, showcasing the benefit of leveraging diverse algorithms to capture different aspects of sentiment in tweets. This approach holds promise for understanding public opinion and sentiment trends on social media platforms.
